            <div class="sb2">Baron came to New York in 1982, at the age of 20. <br> 
                “Anything that was interesting or <br>
                new — whether in music, painting or pop culture — came from here <br>
                and <br>
                I wanted to be where it was happening, <br>
                I wanted to be on the frontline!”

            <div class="sb3">
                Baron은 1982년 20세의 나이로 뉴욕으로 왔습니다. <br>
                “음악, 그림, 대중 문화 등 흥미롭거나 새로운 모든 것이 뉴욕에서 왔으며 <br> 
                저는 그것이 일어나는 곳에 있고 싶었습니다. 최전선, 뉴욕에서!”

            NEW YORK, United States — “I like beauty, but it needs to vibrate. I like the slap in the face,” says Fabien Baron, <br> 
            who has been in the business of making beauty vibrate for over twenty years now, <br>
            imbuing fashion images with just enough tension and feeling that the viewer may indeed feel struck in the face. <br>
            <br>
            Over the course of more than two decades, the Paris-born, New York-based Baron has reinvented five magazines, <br>
            including Italian and French Vogue, and set the aesthetic benchmark for countless others, <br>
            which have emulated the Frenchman’s signature style, characterised by generous expanses of white space, <br>
            elegantly punctuated with bold black typefaces,<br>
            a visual language he first introduced as creative director of Harper’s Bazaar in the 1990s.<br>
            <br>
            Currently, Baron is the editorial director of Interview magazine and runs his own design and branding agency, <br>
            Baron & Baron, through which he has shaped the visual identities of global fashion brands like Calvin Klein, <br>
            creating iconic print and television campaigns, packaging and, in recent years, <br>
            digital work, including web films, a medium Baron has called “the future of branding.”<br>
            <br>
            Baron grew up in the 12th arrondissement of Paris in an artistic family. <br>
            His father was an art director too and Baron’s early exposure to his father’s métier gave him a rigorous foundation <br>
            that continues to inform his work today. “My dad was doing more of the journalistic side of art direction, <br>
            for newspapers, and I was really intrigued by the machine of it all, the pace. <br>
            There were no computers at the time, just huge linotype machines<br>
            that weighed tons and used metal plates. There was an adrenaline rush about it all.”<br>
            <br>
            Baron went on to work with his father. <br>
            And if there’s a certain journalistic clarity to the younger Baron’s famous layouts,<br>
            it’s thanks to Baron senior, from whom the budding art director learned “a very structured approach, <br>
            really how to organise the information, to say, <br>
            ‘Ok the title needs to be like that, then what’s the subtitle, captions, etcetera.”<br>
            <br>
            From an early age, Baron was also fascinated with fashion magazines. <br>
            “When I was 13 or 14 years old, I was looking at French Vogue, amazed by Helmut Newton and Guy Bourdin’s images.<br>
            I was going crazy. <br>
            I fell in love with photography really early on and got my first camera when I was 17. <br>
            Art direction is how I make my living, but photography remains my personal love.”<br>
            <br>
            Baron came to New York in 1982, at the age of 20.<br>
            “Anything that was interesting or new — whether in music, painting or pop culture — came from here <br>
            and I wanted to be where it was happening, I wanted to be on the frontline!”<br>
            <br>
            “In the 80s, New York was a totally different city than it is now, it was dangerous, it was cool, <br>
            really harsh, really raw. My first years in New York were tough. It was hard. <br>
            I knew only one person [Veronique Vienne], an art director at WWD. <br>
            She was my way in. I arrived with only 300 dollars in my pocket and bad English.” <br>
            But the young Baron was hungry. <br>
            “The day after I arrived I was going around the city with my portfolio, looking for work.”<br>
            <br>
            A meeting with Condé Nast editorial director Alexander Liberman changed the course of Baron’s career. <br>
            “I went to see him, he spoke to me in French, looked at my portfolio and bought some pictures <br>
            I had taken of the Brooklyn Bridge on the spot for $600.” Apart from putting some cash in his pocket, <br>
            the meeting resulted in Baron’s first serious publishing job, at GQ, where he worked under Mary Shanahan, <br>
            one of three critical mentors.<br>
            <br>
            “She made me understand clearly how an image can function, <br>
            how you can create an image.<br>
            That I didn’t know really because my experience was in typography; <br>
            this whole idea that you have to come in with a point of view and bring that point-of-view across <br>
            and then you build an image with the photographer. I saw Mary do it and I was mesmerized; it was like eating a pie.”<br>
            <br>
            In the mid-80s, Baron left GQ to become the art director of New York Woman,<br>
            a magazine published by American Express. <br>
            “Because of New York Woman I got advertising jobs and soon I was doing all the Barneys advertising, <br>
            including the famous campaign with Steven Meisel and Naomi and Christy.”<br>
            <br>
            It was Meisel who referred Baron to Franca Sozzani, who had just been offered the top job at Italian Vogue. <br>
            When Sozzani offered Baron a position, he agreed on the spot. <br>
            “Working with Franca is where I really learned about fashion. I met all the designers,<br>
            I was going to the shows, I was now in the fashion business. <br>
            And that’s when I started to do advertising campaigns for Giorgio Armani and Valentino.<br>
            I had my own little thing on the side.”<br>
            <br>
            Barons’ third great mentor was Liz Tilberis, <br>
            the legendary British editor with whom he redesigned Harper’s Bazaar in 1992. <br>
            “From Tilberis I learned management and how to communicate with people in a nice way.<br>
            She was the most amazing editor I have worked with and knew how to get the best out of everyone that worked for her. <br>
            She gave you freedom, just the right amount of room for you to find the thing she was looking for.<br>
            It was an incredible skill she had; so you thought ‘Oh, I have all this freedom I can do whatever I want,’ <br>
            but at the end you were totally delivering exactly what she was looking for.<br>
            ” Tilberis died of cancer in 1999. “I got really sad when she passed away, I had to quit.”<br>
            <br>
            Baron often describes his style as direct. <br>
            “I like things to be very simple and very direct and to have a certain balance.<br>
            There has to be harmony but also vibration, it needs to be dynamic and powerful.<br>
            I work really, really hard at it. And I’m constantly asking myself, ‘Has it been done already?’ because then I can’t do it.” <br>
            <br>
            “People think being an art director is just about going on shoots and being on set, but that’s only a fraction of my job.” <br>
            In fact, Baron often functions as a sort of matchmaker, <br>
            finding the right talents for the right brand long before a photo shoot. <br>
            “I think I have been successful because I know how to pair things together; <br>
            I know how to take a problem, an equation, and solve it. In fact, problem-solving is tremendous, <br>
            a huge part of my job. A lot of it is being the person that is stuck between everyone, you are there from the beginning, <br>
            the birth of idea, to when it is produced, edited, corrected, retouched and printed.<br>
            And the entire spectrum is not as glamorous as it sounds; it means dealing with a lot of people.”<br>
            <br>
            It’s no exaggeration to say that Baron’s distinctive aesthetic has become the lingua franca of fashion. <br>
            “My type of design has become so mainstream, <br>
            you see it everywhere, from the Gap’s sales signs down to Tomato soup cans, <br>
            on which I recognise my type. I think I opened the door for people to see in another way, and, of course, <br>
            it has become common ground. Someone has to break the door, so we can all go in and do things with it.”<br>
            <br>
            So, what advice would Baron give young art directors trying to break into the industry?<br>
            <br>
            “First of all I would say go for it, but you have to be ready to work really hard <br>
            and not feel entitled and be willing to pay your dues.<br>
            To build an image there are all these components which you have to master<br>
            and understand how to solve the problem. <br>
            Being an art director is not about doing good type.<br>
            That’s being a graphic designer. To be an art director you have to have ideas, <br>
            an understanding of all these layers and you have to have an extreme enthusiasm to pass along to the team <br>
            and to make them feel light enough so they can execute.”<br>
            <br>
            Indeed, it’s perhaps his infectious enthusiasm,<br>
            more than anything, that has made Baron one the most successful creatives working in fashion today. <br>
            “I am never really working, I am having fun. I love what I do. I really, really love it and enjoy it so much. <br>
            If I didn’t have it, what would I do? I don’t know, I would be really bored.”<br>
